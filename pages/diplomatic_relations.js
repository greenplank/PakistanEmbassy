                    Pakistan and Sweden enjoy friendly and cooperative relations
                    characterised by mutual respect, understanding and
                    cooperation. Sweden was the first Scandinavian country to
                    establish diplomatic relations with Pakistan, in 1949. Since
                    establishment of diplomatic relations, both countries have
                    enjoyed multifaceted and fruitful cooperation over the years
                    especially in trade, economy, education, culture and
                    people-to-people contacts. There have been regular contacts
                    between the leadership of two countries and the two sides
                    also hold regular Bilateral Political Consultations.
