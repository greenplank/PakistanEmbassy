                    National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) is an
                    identity card for Pakistanis living abroad.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="mb-30 mt-30 text-left">What is CNIC?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) is an identity
                    card for Pakistani citizens living in Pakistan.
                  </p>
                  <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
                    <p>
                      <b>Please note</b> that CNIC and NICOP both are national
                      ID cards. Citizen number or Nadra ID number for both cards
                      is the same for an individual. Also note that Smart ID
                      Card or Smart NICOP has the only difference of microchip
                      on it. So there is nothing to get confused between Nicop
                      and SmartNicop.

                  <p>
                    Pakistan Origin Card (POC) is an identity card which is
                    issued to those Pakistani origin individuals who have
                    renounced their Pakistani nationality. POC holder is not a
                    Pakistani citizen but he/she may travel and stay in Pakistan
                    without visa as long as POC card is valid.
