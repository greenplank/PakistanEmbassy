                  We also hope to provide you with a more user-friendly
                  experience of our consular services. We have tried to make it
                  a one window comprehensive information portal for those
                  interested in travelling to Pakistan or doing business with
                  Pakistan. In particular we are pleased with the guides for
                  those who wish to study and work in Sweden and compilation of
                  resources for teaching Urdu language.
